Short Description WP Accessibility Helper helps solve accessibility problems

== Description ==

<strong>WordPress Accessibility made easy!</strong>

Web accessibility refers to the inclusive practice of removing barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to websites, by people with disabilities. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, all users have equal access to information and functionality.

WP Accessibility Helper helps solve accessibility problems like font size, contrast, titles and aria-label tags, images alt and more.

== Upgrade notice ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I report security bugs? =
You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/wp-accessibility-helper)

= I can not see the accessibility icon. What shoud I do? =
Please verify that your WordPress theme has: <pre><code>wp_head();</code></pre><pre><code>wp_footer();</code></pre> and your body tag has <pre><code>body_class();</code></pre>

= Font Settings =

You should use REM units resize, only when your theme is built with REM units, not in PX (pixels). Zoom in/out page will be useful for websites with unclear html/css standards, a website that was overridden and fixed several times. For example, one part of a code was written in REM units, and the second part – in pixels or percents… Script base resize option will be useful for… everyone =) This script calculates font size for the next HTML tags: h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6,a.
